# Carrot-Catcher

A short game I made in about a week.
I was introduced to the engine, Love2D, one day, and a week later this project emerged just to prove I could do something and finish it with this new engine on my own.

To play, download everything except the src folder. Your firewall may give you some problems, but I promise it isn'ta virus.
The source files are included in the src folder. You can compile it yourself if you so wish. Information on that can be found on the website for Love2D.

This is also the first game made in the NumberAnimalz universe of games.
